    "# Diffusion\n",
    "The diffusion equation can be used to represent a variety of natural and environmental processes. It was introduced by Fourier in 1822 to calculate the distribution of the temperature in materials and has later been applied by Fick to material science. The mathematical expression that we will derive can be used to model, e.g., heat transfer in the earth's crust, soil evolution, transport of contaminants in an aquifer or in the atmosphere, erosion of mountain ranges, the evolution of glaciers, and many other phenomena. But before describing the equation directly, we will investigate what diffusion actually means.\n",
