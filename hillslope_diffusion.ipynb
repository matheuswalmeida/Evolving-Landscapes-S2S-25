    "# Diffusion\n",
    "The diffusion equation can be used to represent a variety of natural and environmental processes. It was introduced by Fourier in 1822 to calculate the distribution of the temperature in materials and has later been applied by Fick to material science. The mathematical expression that we will derive can be used to model, e.g., heat transfer in the earth's crust, soil evolution, transport of contaminants in an aquifer or in the atmosphere, erosion of mountain ranges, the evolution of glaciers, and many other phenomena. But before describing the equation directly, we will investigate what diffusion actually means.\n",

    "Due to diffusion, the particles move from the black zone to the grey zone. This can be explained by the fact that each particle can move at any moment in any direction, over a given distance. In one dimension, a particle can move to the left or to the right with equal probability, and this as well in the gray region as the black region. However, at the transition from the black zone to the grey zone, the probability of seeing particles move from left to right is much larger than the opposite, because there are many more black particles. This causes a particle transfer that depends on the difference of concentration $\\Delta C$ and the distance that the particle must travel $\\Delta x$, where is the difference of concentration in a transition zone of length $\\Delta X$ . Therefore, we can see that the flow of particles (i.e. the number of particles passing through per unit surface and time (in 2D, mol m<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>) will depend on the concentration gradient. Over time, the concentration changes as illustrated in Figure 2."
